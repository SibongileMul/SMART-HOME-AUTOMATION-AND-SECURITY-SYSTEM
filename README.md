Developed a robust home security and automation system using Arduino IDE, Tinkercad, and IoT Tech Core Kit. 
The system incorporates smart sensors for enhanced security, including automated lights for low-light conditions,
a distance sensor to detect potential intruders, and a door sensor to monitor entrance status. The 
system's modular design allows for easy expansion with optional sensors like temperature and 
humidity for weather monitoring and a water level sensor to prevent potential flooding. 
This project highlights expertise in creating a sophisticated home alarm and sensor system for comprehensive residential monitoring.
